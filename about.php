        <p class="about-text"> Hello! My name is Luke, I am a Digital Media Design student at Bournemouth University. I got my first taste of design when I decided to enrol on a media course at Highlands College in my hometown of Jersey. It was there that I was introduced to programs such as Photoshop and InDesign and my interest grew. After finishing the course I carried on persuing the subject and developing my skills, until I eventually started to focus on the web. This led me to Bournemouth University where I went to progress further.

        What I like about the web is that it never lets you sleep, you can find something that blows your mind away everyday, and out of every answer a hundred other questions and ideas arise. I also enjoy the problem solving aspect of coding; when something isn’t working and you don't understand what it is. This can obviously get frustrating at times but there's a rewarding feeling I get when I finally work it out and that's what makes it so worth it. I respect the innovativeness and passion of digital media designers and that passion has rubbed off on me.

        I hope you enjoy my designs.
